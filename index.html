				<h2>Welcome!</h2>
				<p>Thanks for stopping by, have a look around! There's a growing showcase of my game development endeavors, as well as a collection of music that I have produced. You can think of this as a sort of portfolio, but mostly it's just a personal project that keeps me organized.</p>

						<p>Recently I was browsing the gamedev channels on Twitch, when I happened to come across <a href="https://twitter.com/FourbitFriday">Tyriq Plummer</a> streaming his development of a game called <a href="https://www.ckgame.net/">Catacomb Kids</a>. It's a very complex roguelike platformer, and it caught my attention. So I followed his channel, watched a few streams, and that was it. A bit later, <a href="http://7drl.org/">7DRL (7 Day Rogue-Like)</a> rolled up and I didn't have any good ideas or designs. I love game jams, but it was looking like I was to sit this one out. Defeated but still in the creative mood, I went back to Tyriq's stream, and to my surprise, he was working on his own game for the 7DRL! It looked really interesting, gritty, dark and gothic. The concept and art peaked my interest, enough so that I asked him if I could make music for his entry. He said sure, so I made a couple of demos and sent them out. He happened to like one of the prototypes, and so I went on to make the rest of the soundtrack for the game! It was kind of rushed, so it's not exactly what I want it to be, but I think I nailed the game's style and mood with the music. There's currently four tracks (one is unused in the competition version). We're talking about possibly expanding on the game as time goes on, we'll see! If you would like to give <a href="https://fourbitfriday.itch.io/hvntrs-7drl">H.V.N.T.R.S. a go, download it for free on itch.io</a> and check it out. If you would like to listen to the whole soundtrack, you can <a href="https://soundcloud.com/john-wesley-kbjwes77/sets/hvntrs">listen to it here on Soundcloud</a>. It was heavily influenced by the original Diablo soundtrack by Matt Uelmen, one of my favorite game soundtracks. I look forward to writing more game music in the future, but for now I'm going to focus on the programming side of gamedev again.</p>
