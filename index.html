							<h2>H.V.N.T.R.S. and 7DRL</h2><p><small>03/25/2018</small></p>

							<p>Recently I've been watching a lot of gamedev on Twitch. Recently I came across <a href="https://twitter.com/FourbitFriday">Tyriq Plummer</a> streaming his development of a game called <a href="https://www.ckgame.net/">Catacomb Kids</a>. It's a very complex roguelike platformer, and it caught my attention. So I followed him, watched his streams, and generally just lurked. A bit later, <a href="http://7drl.org/">7DRL (7 Day Rogue-Like)</a> rolled up and I didn't have any good ideas or designs. So I went back to Tyriq's stream, and to my surprise, he was working on a game for 7DRL! It looked really interesting, gritty and dark and gothic. It peaked my interest, enough so that I asked him if I could make music for his entry. He said sure, so I made a couple of demos and sent them out. He liked one of the prototypes, and well I went on to make the rest of the soundtrack for the game. It was rushed, so it's not exactly what I want it to be, but I think I hit the nail on the head for style and mood. There's currently four tracks (one is unused in the competition version). We're talking about possibly expanding on the game as time goes on, we'll see! If you would like to give <a href="https://fourbitfriday.itch.io/hvntrs-7drl">H.V.N.T.R.S. a go, download it for free on itch.io</a> and check it out. If you would like to listen to the whole soundtrack, you can <a href="https://soundcloud.com/john-wesley-kbjwes77/sets/hvntrs">listen to it here on Soundcloud</a>.</p>
