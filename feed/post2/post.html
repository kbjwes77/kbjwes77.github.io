					<h2><a href="/post.html?id=2">The Static Site Generator</a></h2><p><small>03/30/2018</small></p>
					<p id="post-2-text">I'm a programmer. I love to tinker, experiment, and try ridiculous things. I also stay up way too late trying to get these projects to do what I want them to. Anyways, I just wrangled a long-time programming goal of mine. So, Github Pages is a web host, but it serves <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_web_page">static web pages</a>. This means that this website is a group of files on a Github server somewhere, and it is served to you as is, with no fancy databases or scripting. Static web pages are simple to create and they require very little processing power from the server to get the website to you. This is great for small sites and projects where the content doesn't change much, or doesn't need a lot of upkeep. This used to be the case for me, however as my list of projects and games grew, so did the work needed to add them here to my site. That's where my programming project comes in. The basic idea is that I would write a program to stitch together some data and a few template files to write my site for me. So I did just that. In fact, the page you're reading from right now has been pre-processed by the static site generator, and that output is uploaded directly to my Github Pages repo for you to access as part of my website. This system I've created makes it simple to change a template and in turn update all pages that use that template. So instead of rewriting the header of each page to use the latest version of jQuery, I can edit the header template file and every page using that header template gets updated automatically. This should make adding new projects a breeze, as well as posting exciting updates like this! I'm looking forward to my next project, and now you can follow along here as I record my progress and share my game development journey! Well, thanks for reading!</p>
