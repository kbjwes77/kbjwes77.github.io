					<p id="post-5-text">Doing some networking tests, and of course I got side tracked by designing an interesting player avatar. Originally I was going to only have one arm for the player to hold guns, but it looked stiff and didn't read well. So I whipped up a two-arm version in the sprite editor, thought it looked good, but I still wanted it to be more dynamic. Several hours later and with the help of a few cups of coffee, I got a constrained IK solver working for both arms. It's super primitive, so I won't be posting any tutorials or source code, but if you're interested in trying this out for yourself I recommend you <a href="https://tonystr.net/games_and_tools/gml_ik_ext">check out TonyStr's tutorial</a> on the subject, it helped me in figuring out how to solve for pinned segments! I intend to post more updates soon, just ran into a nice little roadblock with some netcode after a good stretch of productivity. Wish me luck!</p>
