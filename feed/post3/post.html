					<p>It's been quite a long time since my last update. Sorry about that. Let's fix that, so I'm going to get right into it. I'm super excited about this past weekend. The 42nd Ludum Dare just finished, along with the LowRezJam. I like to take on a lot of things at once and keep myself busy, but I think I'm finally getting <i>good</i> at it. Working on something for both jams was incredibly stressful, but it has been very rewarding! For the LowRezJam project, I contacted an online acquaintance I know through Discord, <a href="https://twitter.com/bakufreak">@bakufreak</a>, about his entry. I have played his past entries and really enjoyed them, so I thought why not see if I can make some music for the next one! He said yes, so I got to work. Made up a couple prototypes that I might share later, replayed the previous games, got a really good feel for the game, and now two weeks later he's got a beautiful game with some really great music! I'm really happy with how the game turned out, as well as the music I created for each explorable area in <a href="https://baku.itch.io/legend-of-xenia-3d">Legend of Xenia 3D</a>. I'm very proud of how much I accomplished in such a short period of time, I think I'm insane for trying to make something for the Ludum Dare too. Speaking of the Ludum Dare, I'm getting some really positive feedback on <a href="https://kbjwes77.github.io/gamedev/cqc/">my entry</a>. Even though I didn't have time for the Compo, I think that it's still a fun little game that I'm really glad I took a chance on. I'll admit, it wasn't the most responsible thing to do by taking time (and potentially quality) away from someone's project. However, I think I needed to really push myself like I did, it really gives me the confidence that I'm becoming a better composer. I'm not claiming to be great or better than anybody else, but I can recognize that I'm improving. I proved that to myself this past weekend, and as exhausted as I am, it was a turning point for me in seeing how far I've really come. I'm excited for the future, and I look forward to where I'll be when I write my next post. Keep working at it!</p>
