					<h2><a href="/post.html?id=3">I'm alive! (LowRezJam and LD42 Post-Mortem)</a></h2><p><small>08/17/2018</small></p>
					<p id="post-3-text">It's been quite a long time since my last update. Let's fix that, just get right into it. Although I'm still recovering, I'm super excited about how this past weekend went. The 42nd Ludum Dare just finished, along with the LowRezJam. Yeah... I like to take on too many things at once. I call it keeping myself busy, but as of yesterday I've realized something's changed. I think I'm finally <i>seeing progess</i>. Working on something for both jams was incredibly stressful, but it has been very rewarding! For the LowRezJam project, I contacted an online acquaintance, <a href="https://twitter.com/bakufreak">@bakufreak</a>, about what would be his upcoming entry. I have played his past entries in the series, and really quite enjoyed them. So I thought, why not see if I can make some music for this next one! Got a hold of him, pitched the idea, and fortunately his answer was yes! I got to work immediately. I started by replaying the previous two Legend of Xenia games (both of which were 2D), then made up a couple prototypes that I may or may not share later. After a bit of back and forth and some much needed feedback, I nailed down a theme with the what I think captures a general feel of the game, and well two weeks later he's got a beautiful game with some really great music! I'm really happy with how the game turned out, as well as many of the tracks I created for each explorable area. I'm very proud of how much I accomplished in such a short period of time. Well, I would have had more time if I hadn't tried to make something for the Ludum Dare as well. Though, I am getting some really positive feedback on <a href="https://kbjwes77.github.io/gamedev/cqc/">my entry</a>. I'm really glad I took a chance on. I'll admit, it wasn't the most responsible thing to do, I should be careful about taking time (and potentially quality) away from someone's project. However, I think that I needed to really push myself like I did, it has really given me the confidence that I'm becoming a better composer. I'm not claiming to be great or stroking my ego, but I can recognize that I'm improving, and it has been very reassuring. I tested my limits and proved my abilities to myself. As exhausted as I am, I can't help but be excited for the future. I look forward to where I'll be when I write my next post. Keep working at it, never give up!<br>You can play <a href="https://twitter.com/bakufreak">@Bakufreak's</a> entry, <a href="https://baku.itch.io/legend-of-xenia-3d">'Legend of Xenia 3D' here</a>, and <a href="https://soundcloud.com/john-wesley-kbjwes77/sets/lox3d">listen to the soundtrack I've created here!</a> You can also check out <a href="https://kbjwes77.github.io/gamedev/cqc/">my Ludum Dare entry, 'CQC' here!</a></p>
