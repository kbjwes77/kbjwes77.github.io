					<p id="post-6-text">Three months into 2019, and I'm finally writing my first post of the year! I haven't had anything to show for a while, but in my opinion, it was worth the wait! I've been busy making things. What kind of things? Well, first of all I've written an open source group voice-chat bundle, a neural network trained using an implementation of Stochastic Gradient Descent that can recognize handwritten digits, and a shader demo that gives you a tour of the infinitely complex Mandelbrot set. The easiest was the Mandelbrot shader, and that involved relearning how to write a shader. Don't even ask how long it took for me to understand the math behind back propogation. I had to do quite a bit of research and brushing up on my maths to see these projects through! It feels good to finally share them with you, I really pushed myself outside my comfort zone, and it feels like it paid off. Along with those three projects, I've rewritten my old Quadtree Image Decomposition experiment to work in your browser, and refactored a lot of the site's content and presentation. All the images you see are now compressed (that includes texture pages used in the demos), and pages with large numbers of images use heavier compression. Lastly, I've setup a template system to dynamically load page footers and other templates into the page structure. The site is steadily becoming easier to mantain, and as a result I will gradually have more time for creating demos, writing music, and growing the site instead of trying to keep up with fixing it. I'll likely have another post soon, I have a few demo ideas that I want to put together in the near future. We're moving forward, and there's much more to come! Stay tuned!</p>
